                  <p>“Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself.” ― Leo Tolstoy</p>

                  <p>My journey into web development is a somewhat unconventional one. I have had a very successful
                      career, but not in computers. As a pediatirican in Rochester, NH for the last 30 plus years, 
                      I have helped thousands of children and parents lead succesful, healthy lives and started and 
                      run a successful business.</p>
                      
                  <p>In politics, I have served many roles as well, both on party level and locally, inculding all 
                      the way to Mayor of Rochester (a tough job indeed). I have also served many leading roles in 
                      many non-profit organiztions, with much enjoyment.</p>
                      
                  <p>As I wind down in my medical career, it has brought me to reflect on what other career I might 
                      have pursued if circumstances had been different. It always come back to computers. I was born 
                      in a time before computers, when no one had any idea what the future would hold. The first paper 
                      I every wrote on a computer was my college biology these on the mainframe in the college library, 
                      printed out on continuous stationary on a 9 pin printer, ripping yards of holes off the sides. 
                      The first computer I owned was a Texas Instruments TI99, programming in Basic and recording the 
                      data via sound on a cassette tape. When I was chosing my career, computers were definitely in their 
                      infancy, and I went another path.</p>
                      
                  <p>Now, I am on a new life-path into web development. I bring a lifetime of experience, which makes 
                      me look at the human side, how people will truly interact with what I will create. For technology 
                      to trully be useful, you have to understand what the user really wants, and also, what they will tolerate.</p>
